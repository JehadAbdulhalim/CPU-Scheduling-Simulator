CPU Scheduling Simulator

A fully interactive **CPU Scheduling Simulator** built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
It visually demonstrates how different CPU scheduling algorithms work using a dynamic Gantt chart, real-time metrics, and customizable process inputs.

---

Features

- Supports **7 scheduling algorithms**:
  1. FCFS (First Come First Served)
  2. SJF (Shortest Job First)
  3. SRJF (Shortest Remaining Job First)
  4. Round Robin (with custom quantum)
  5. Non-Preemptive Priority
  6. Preemptive Priority
  7. Round Robin with Non-Preemptive Priority

- Dynamic **Gantt chart** animation showing process execution order
- Real-time metrics:
  - Waiting Time
  - Turnaround Time
  - Response Time
  - Throughput (based on user-defined time window)
- Interactive table to enter process data
- Automatically calculates and displays averages for all metrics
- Clean, responsive design built with vanilla CSS
